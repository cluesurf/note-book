    title: Map Your Thoughts into Structured Knowledge
    description: |
      These trees are probably the simplest and easiest trees of text to read and write which you could conjure up. Frameworks can be built around the trees to process them, link them together into networks, and allow them to be used for optimized computation. The resulting runtime structures can be finely tuned infinitely from there, resulting in clean code, readable data, and fast programs.

      When taking notes in structured ways, Note makes it practical and straightforward to quickly whip together intuitive Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) of all shapes and kinds. It is also more powerful than pure JSON or YAML, because it can be thought of as code. It's all in how you leverage it to get the most power from it. It doesn't come with any bells and whistles, all of that can be found in tools built on top of this like [BaseNote](https://base.surf).
